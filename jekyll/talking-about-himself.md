# Hi there

I'm Frank Gjertsen, a web designer and front-end developer from Norway. I built my first website in 2005, and have ever since been inspired by the flexibility there is on the internet.

I started my own business as a web designer back in 2007, and I now working full time at [FrontKom] in Fredrikstad.

## Give some back
I always try to improve usability, accessibility and quality of my work. And there is always something new to learn.

This blog is my attempt to write about what I learn, mainly because I think that makes me learn better, but I also want to share something back to the community that have given me so much.

## Contact me
Got any questions or comments, feel free to [email me](mailto:frank.gjertsen@gmail.com) or send me a tweet to [@fragje](https://twitter.com/fragje)
