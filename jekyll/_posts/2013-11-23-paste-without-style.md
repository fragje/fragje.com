Once in a while I learn small tips and tricks that makes life easier. It does not need to be a big thing if it’s just repetitive enough. That also means that its a bigger chance to remember it in the end.

## Annoying text formatting
Have you ever tried to copy text from a rich text editor like word, or even text from the internet? It depends where you then paste it, but in some cases you’ll get all the text formatting from where you copied your text. For me that happened when I was pasting text to my mail application, evernote and various wysiwyg editors. 

One way I worked around the problem was to paste the text into a browser url bar and then copied again. This time it copied it without formatting. If it was a larger text block I would paste it into a code editor or plane text application like TextEdit on mac osx.

## Mavericks OS X for the win
Even though this works it is time consuming and boring. I don’t know why I had not searched for it before, but the other day I was trying to figure out if {.link-class}[Alfred] could help me out. Alfred turned me down (for the first time maybe), but luckily though I found out that osx had a built in shortcut for doing this. When I now have text with formatting in my clipboard and want to paste it, instead of using the shortcut `⌘ (command) + v`, I now press `⇧ (shift) + ⌥ (option) + ⌘ (command) + v`. It's a bit long, but still I find easier than manually removing the text formating. Hurray!

I don't know about windows and linux, but I guess there is a similar shortcut for doing the same thing there. Leave a comment if you know.
